# Task ID: 4
# Title: Finalize Packaging and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Prepare the package for npm publication by creating comprehensive documentation and ensuring the build process is correct.
# Details:
Create a detailed `README.md` including installation (`npm install -g`), usage (`npx wordcount-mcp`), Claude Desktop configuration example, and API documentation for each tool. Ensure the `files` array in `package.json` is correct. Add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT).

# Test Strategy:
Review the generated `README.md` for clarity and accuracy. Perform a dry run of `npm publish` (`npm publish --dry-run`) to check for packaging issues. Install the package locally from the tarball to simulate a user installation.
