			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Project Setup and Scaffolding",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Initialize a new npm project using `npm init -y`. Create the following directory structure: `src/`, `src/tools/`, `src/utils/`. Then, create a `.gitignore` file and populate it with standard patterns for Node.js projects, ensuring `node_modules/`, `dist/`, and any OS-specific files (e.g., `.DS_Store`) are ignored.",
			"reasoning": "This is a low-complexity task consisting of standard, well-defined boilerplate commands and file creation. The steps are deterministic and require minimal problem-solving. It can be split into two logical parts: project initialization/structure and file configuration, making it easy to manage."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Text Analysis Logic",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "In a new file `src/utils/text-analyzer.ts`, implement and export a function named `count_characters`. This function should accept a string as input and return its length. It must handle edge cases gracefully, returning 0 for null, undefined, or empty string inputs. Accompany this with a new test file `src/utils/text-analyzer.test.ts` containing unit tests for this function, covering valid inputs, an empty string, and null/undefined inputs.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity is moderate. While some functions are trivial (`string.length`), others like `count_sentences` require nuanced logic to handle edge cases (e.g., abbreviations). The requirement for comprehensive unit tests for each function adds to the workload. Breaking this into 5 subtasks, one for each function and its tests, is a natural and efficient way to divide the work."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop MCP Server and Tools",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "In `src/index.ts`, add a shebang `#!/usr/bin/env node`. Import `Server` and `StdioServerTransport` from `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`. Create an async `main` function that initializes the server with the Stdio transport and an empty tool list. In `src/tools/wordcount-tools.ts`, define and export an array of tools. Start by creating the `count_characters` tool, defining its name, description, a Zod schema for input (`{ text: z.string() }`), and a handler that calls the corresponding function from `text-analyzer.ts`.",
			"reasoning": "This task's complexity comes from integrating with external libraries (`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `zod`), which requires specific domain knowledge. Debugging the interaction between the core logic and the server framework can be challenging. Splitting it into two subtasks—server setup and tool definition—provides a clear separation between establishing the communication layer and implementing the application's API."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Finalize Packaging and Documentation",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a `README.md` file in the project root. Add a project title, a short description, and sections for 'Installation' (with `npm install -g ...`) and 'Usage' (with `npx ...`). Also, create a `LICENSE` file and populate it with the MIT License text, replacing the year and copyright holder name.",
			"reasoning": "While not technically complex, this task requires significant attention to detail. High-quality documentation is a distinct skill, and correct package configuration is critical for a successful release. The task is best broken down into three distinct activities: documentation (`README`), legal (`LICENSE`), and technical configuration (`package.json`)."

		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Release Preparation and Final Testing",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create a performance benchmark script at `scripts/benchmark.ts`. This script should import the analysis functions, generate a large text sample (e.g., 10,000 words), and use `console.time` and `console.timeEnd` to measure the execution time of each analysis function against the sample text. The script should be runnable via an npm script.",
			"reasoning": "The complexity lies in the procedural rigor and the variety of validation required. End-to-end and performance testing can be non-trivial to set up correctly. The release process itself is high-stakes and error-prone. Separating the task into testing, release prep (versioning, changelog), and the final publication action ensures each critical stage is handled carefully."
